# Mugen Bot

A small bot I made to practice python and allow people to publically select random characters on a discord server.

Uses py-cord, as that is the best supported discord library at the time of writing, and python 3.10.

## Installation

First, install python 3.10. Then, install the dependancies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
